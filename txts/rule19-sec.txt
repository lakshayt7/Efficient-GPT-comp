As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
identify, monitor, and manage the material risks to the covered clearing agency arising from
arrangements in which firms that are indirect participants in the covered clearing agency rely on
the services provided by direct participants in the covered clearing agency to access the covered
clearing agency’s payment, clearing, or settlement facilities (hereinafter “tiered participation
arrangements”). In addition, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) would require that a covered
clearing agency establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to regularly review the material risks to the covered clearing agency arising
from such tiered participation arrangements.

The Commission is providing the following guidance that a covered clearing
agency generally should consider in establishing and maintaining policies and procedures that
address tiered participation arrangements:
• whether a covered clearing agency ensures that its rules, procedures, and agreements
allow it to gather sufficient information about indirect participation to identify, monitor, 


• whether a covered clearing agency ensures that its rules, procedures, and agreements
allow it to gather sufficient information about indirect participation to identify, monitor,
498 See supra notes 491, 494, and accompanying text.

and manage any material risks to the covered clearing agency arising from such tiered
participation arrangements;
• whether it identifies material dependencies between direct and indirect participants that
might affect the covered clearing agency;
• whether it identifies indirect participants responsible for a significant proportion of
transactions processed by the covered clearing agency and indirect participants whose
transaction volumes or values are large relative to the capacity of the direct participants
through which they access the covered clearing agency to manage the risks arising from
these transactions; and
• whether it regularly reviews risks arising from tiered participation arrangements and
takes mitigation action when appropriate.


In addition to the guidance above, the Commission notes that, when addressing its compliance
with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19), a covered clearing agency could consider whether its rules, policies,
procedures, and agreements with direct participants allow it to gather basic information about
indirect participants to identify, monitor, and manage any material risks to the covered clearing
agency arising from such tiered participation arrangements. This information should help enable
the covered clearing agency to identify (i) the proportion of activity that direct participants
conduct on behalf of indirect participants, (ii) direct participants that act on behalf of a material
number of indirect participants, (iii) indirect participants with significant volumes or values of
transactions in the system, and (iv) indirect participants whose transaction volumes or values are
large relative to those of the direct participants through which they access the covered clearing
agency. In this vein, a covered clearing agency could consider an indirect participant’s status as
a designated market maker or supplemental liquidity provider in identifying material risks to the
219
covered clearing agency.

 A covered clearing agency could also consider different trading
strategies or changes in trading strategies used by indirect participants in identifying, monitoring,
and managing material risks to the covered clearing agency.

The Commission also notes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) is intended to promote the ongoing
management of risks associated with tiered participation arrangements stemming from the
dependencies and risk exposures that such arrangements can create; However, because proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) only addresses the situation where indirect participants in the covered
clearing agency rely on direct participants, the Commission notes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19)
would not apply in the circumstance where a covered clearing agency providing CSD services
has members that are broker-dealers maintaining accounts for retail customers
