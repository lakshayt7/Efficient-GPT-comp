As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
effectively measure, monitor, and manage the liquidity risk that arises in or is borne by it, by
meeting, at a minimum, the ten requirements specified in the rule.

Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) would require that a covered clearing agency’s policies
and procedures be reasonably designed to ensure that it maintains sufficient liquid resources in
all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where appropriate, intraday and multiday
settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of
potential stress scenarios that includes the default of the participant family that would generate
the largest aggregate payment obligation for it in extreme but plausible market conditions.

Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that it holds qualifying liquid resources sufficient to meet the minimum liquidity resource
requirement in each relevant currency for which the covered clearing agency has payment obligations owed to clearing members. The Commission also proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(15)
to define “qualifying liquid resources,” which would include three types of assets, in each
relevant currency:
• cash held either at the central bank of issue or at creditworthy commercial banks;
• assets that are readily available and convertible into cash through either:
o prearranged funding arrangements without material adverse change limitations,
such as committed lines of credit, foreign exchange swaps, and repurchase
agreements, or
o other prearranged funding arrangements determined to be highly reliable even in
extreme but plausible market conditions by the board of directors of the covered
clearing agency following a review conducted for this purpose not less than
annually; and
• other assets that are readily available and eligible for pledging to (or conducting other
appropriate forms of transactions with) a relevant central bank, if the covered clearing
agency has access to routine credit at such central bank.


Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
it uses accounts and services at a Federal Reserve Bank, pursuant to Section 806(a) of the
Clearing Supervision Act,344 or other relevant central bank, when available and wheredetermined to be practical by the board of directors of the covered clearing agency, to enhance
its management of liquidity risk.

Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iv) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
it undertakes due diligence to confirm that it has a reasonable basis to believe each of its liquidity
providers, whether or not such liquidity provider is a clearing member, has sufficient information
to understand and manage the liquidity provider’s liquidity risks, and the capacity to perform as
required under its commitments to provide liquidity.

Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(v) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that the covered clearing agency maintains and, on at least an annual basis, tests with each
liquidity provider, to the extent practicable, its procedures and operational capacity for accessing
each type of relevant liquidity resource.

Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(A) through (C) would require a covered clearing
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to determine the amount and regularly test the sufficiency of the liquid resources held
for purposes of meeting the minimum liquid resource requirement of proposed Rule 17Ad-
22(e)(7)(i) by (A) conducting a stress test of its liquidity resources at least once each day using
standard and predetermined parameters and assumptions; (B) conducting a comprehensive
analysis of the existing stress testing scenarios, models, and underlying parameters and
assumptions used in evaluating liquidity needs and resources, and considering modifications to
ensure they are appropriate for determining the covered clearing agency’s identified liquidity
needs and resources in light of current and evolving market conditions at least once each month;
and (C) conducting a comprehensive analysis of the existing stress testing scenarios, models, and
underlying parameters and assumptions used in evaluating liquidity needs and resources more
frequently when products cleared or markets served display high volatility or become less liquid,
when the size or concentration of positions held by participants increases significantly, or in
other circumstances described in the covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures;
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(D) would also require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to result in
reporting the results of the analyses performed under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(B) and
(C) to appropriate decision makers, including the risk management committee or board of
directors, at the covered clearing agency for use in evaluating the adequacy of and adjusting its
liquidity risk management framework.

Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to result in
performing an annual or more frequent conforming model validation of its liquidity risk
models.

Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(viii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to address
foreseeable liquidity shortfalls that would not be covered by its liquid resources and seek to
avoid unwinding, revoking, or delaying the same-day settlement of payment obligations.

Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ix) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to describe
its process for replenishing any liquid resources that it may employ during a stress event.


Finally, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(x) would require a covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to ensure that it, at least once a year, evaluates the feasibility of maintaining sufficient liquid
resources at a minimum in all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where appropriate,
intraday and multiday settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under
a wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios that includes, but is not limited to, the default of the
two participant families that would potentially cause the largest aggregate payment obligation for
the covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible market conditions if the covered clearing
agency provides CCP services and is either systemically important in multiple jurisdictions or a
clearing agency involved in activities with a more complex risk profile
